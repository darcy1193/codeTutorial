AUTOMATION FOR C PROGRAMS FOUND IN codeTutorial/cPrograms
	
Compiling:  To compile the programs described in the CCodeTutorial.md file one must start in the root folder "codeTutorial" and "cd" into the directory "cPrograms". Once in the "cPrograms" directory the command "make" will compile all c programs.	

Running:  Once the c programs are compiled they are ready to run. To run all of the c files and produce output files in the cPrograms/outputFiles folder the command "make run" must be executed.

Cleaning:  To remove all .o files in codeTutorial/cPrograms and output files from codeTutorial/cPrograms/outputFiles the command make clean must be executed from the code:Tutorial/cPrograms directory.
